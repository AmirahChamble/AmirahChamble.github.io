                <h3>Hi. I’m a UX Designer and Developer. I love building cool stuff that makes real people happy and learning new things. I’m really into building <a href="https://projekt202.com/design-systems" target="_blank">Design Systems</a>, Games, and UX/UI Research & Development.</h3>
      
                <p>I’m currently at Bloomberg BNA as UX Design System Engineer, working on their <a href="https://fishtank.bna.com/" target="_blank">Design Systems Fish Tank’s</a> Web Components. My responsibilities have ranged from determining the scope of web component functionality to the development of web components using the Vue.js framework, the design & code documentation on both the documentation site and the codeSandobox IDE for Fish Tank users, along with the maintenance and deployment of the Fish Tank Documentation site and it’s libraries.</p>
      
                <!-- <p>Since I’ve graduated from the University of Maryland College Park, I’ve worked for both a Virtual Reality Startup and an Enterprise Corporation in both Design and Engineering roles; having both the opportunities to improve the user experience of existing products through user research and design as well as the opportunity to develop those solutions. I love collaborating with talented people and sharing exchanging new skills.</p>
      
                <p>Previous to this role at Bloomberg BNA, I was a UX Designer at the same company working on Bloomberg Environment’s Environment Health and Safety Products, including Reg Tracker, Global Auditor, Domestic Auditor, and Cite-It Tool, along with several other in-house publishing products doing complete UX Redesigns to improve user workflows and update the mentioned products the company’s current style guidelines.</p>
      
                <p>I Graduated in May of 2017 from the University of Maryland College Park with a B.A. in Art Studio. In addition to my studies during my senior year, I worked for MPLEXVR, a virtual reality startup as a Concept Character & Environment Artist / Developer. At the time, that meant I got to wear many hats, from building game ready assets in 3D modeling programs like Blender to scripting visual shaders, VFX, game and web UI/UX. I picked up many new skills, including personal love for game development, which is now one of my favorite hobbies.</p>
      
                <p>Prior to my graduation from the University of Maryland and working for MPLEXVR, I worked for Bloomberg BNA as Software Developer Intern for two summers. I interned under the then titled Product Research and Development Department’s Bloomberg Law and Big Law Business, learning first hand how to develop Ruby on Rails, Wordpress, and Angular.Js Applications, as well as learning how to build Ruby Gems to share reusable code across other Ruby Framework Applications.</p>
       -->
                <p>So far my journey has been one of continuous learning, which is why I love collaborating with talented people and exchanging new skills. I’m always looking for room to flourish and grow.</p>
